Introduction

Pharmacogenomics (PGX) is the study of how an individual's genetic makeup affects their response to drugs. PGX testing provides information about how a person's genes may impact their response to specific medications. This repository focuses on the analysis of PGX TaqMan Genotyping data generated by Quantstudios.
Requirements

    Python 3
    NumPy
    pandas
    hl7
    Matplotlib

Installation

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pgx-taqman-genotyping.git
    cd pgx-taqman-genotyping

Install the required Python packages:



    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Place your raw PGX TaqMan Genotyping data files (CSV format) in the specified input directory.

    Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

    Run the main script:

    python main.py

    Review the generated reports in the output directory.

Functionality

The code provides the following functionality:

    Data Processing: Reads raw PGX TaqMan Genotyping data, cleans and organizes the information.
    Translation: Translates the results of the TaqMan Genotyping assays to Genotype-Phenotype (GT-PT) information.
    Report Generation: Generates review reports, full data reports, and reports suitable for HL7 reporting.
    PDF Generation: Creates a PDF file containing tables for reviewing PGX TaqMan Genotyping results.
    HL7 Reporting: Prepares Genotype-Phenotype (GT-PT) results DataFrame for HL7 reporting.

Results

The results include review reports, full data reports, and HL7-compatible reports. The PDF file provides a visual representation of the data for easy review.
